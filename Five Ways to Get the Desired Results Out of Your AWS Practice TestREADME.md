# Five Ways to Get the Desired Results Out of Your AWS Practice Test

Here are some pointers to help you get the most out of your practice drill:

1. First, complete a subject-by-topic practice exam to ensure that you understand each topic; not every training and certification provider does this, but Netcom Learning does, which is why I suggest them. You can check the link below: https://www.netcomlearning.com/amazon-web-services-training/vendor/104/?advid=1356

2. Solve as many full-length practice papers as you can. Solve them within a stipulated time.

3. Solve in an authentic exam-like atmosphere, which involves turning off your phone and taking the test in a quiet room with a camera turned on.

4. Revisit both right and wrong questions to grasp the reasoning behind the responses. First, read through the erroneous ones since they are more crucial to fix, and then quickly glance over the correct ones to see if there is any confusion or surprise.

5. Keep track of your progress, speed, and accuracy. Check to see if you can answer all of the questions in the allotted time, 90 minutes.

Thatâ€™s all there is to some of the most excellent AWS Cloud Practitioner Practice exams you can take to ace your exam. By the way, simply completing practice problems is insufficient; you must also examine both correct and incorrect questions to comprehend why the correct answer is correct and why the wrong answer is incorrect. I generally do this while taking a mock test, and I learn a lot in the process. This has also assisted me in correcting any misconceptions I may have.
